# go-sudoku-solver

A sudoku solver built from scratch using next js.

---

#### rules of the game

- a 9x9 grid must be filled with numbers between 1-9
- a number shouldnt be repeated in a row
- a number shouldnt be repeated in a column
- a number shouldnt be repeated in a sub-grid
- a subgrid is a 3x3 grid inside the original 9x9
- there a 9 subgrids on a board
- a board should only have one unique solution

#### goals of this project

==> Goal 1: represent the sudoku board
==> Goal 2: figure out a way to place random but solvable numbers in board
==> Goal 3: create algorithm to solve the board
==> Goal 4: allow board to generate numbers and also solve it
==> Goal 5: create a tui that creates and solve the board

#### tech stack

==> Golang
==> Bubble Tea

#### quick pseudocode on achieving my goals

- use arrays to represent the board
- cells with no number will be represented with 0
- i will use a backtracking algorithm to solve the board
- i will have three main functions, checkColumn(), checkRow(), checkSubGrid()
- checkColumn : checks column of the current cell it is on whether the number exists or not
- checkRow : checks row of the current cell it is on whether the number exists or not
- checkSubGrid : checks subgrid of the current cell it is on whether the number exists or not
- if the number doesnt exist in either the column, row, or subgrid, it moves on to the next empty cell.
- if it exists, move back one cell, increment it by one, then try the functions again.
- this is how it will work until all cells are filled and a solution is gotten.
